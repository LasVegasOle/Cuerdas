// Here is were position data from vision is chopped into values that
// form the shape to be printed

// Take center points of shapes from vision.js
// Calculate the shortest path between shapes and decide closed neighbor 
// for each shape

// Cuerdas, only creates a connection between shapes, to its closest neighbor
// Smae neighbor pairing can not be repeated

// After pairs of neighbors are made strings are created between them based on 
// parameters
// This can be done directly into a GCODE string
